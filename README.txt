Description:
The Arduino Alarm Clock project demonstrates a versatile alarm clock built using Arduino and various components. This project integrates real-time clock (RTC) modules, LCD displays, buttons, and a buzzer to create a functional alarm clock with visual and auditory alerts. Users can set alarms, toggle alarm status, and view time and date information on the LCD display.

Features:
- Real-Time Clock Integration: The project uses the `virtuabotixRTC` library to integrate a real-time clock module for accurate timekeeping and alarm functions.
- LCD Display: A LiquidCrystal_I2C library drives a 2x18 LCD display, showing the current date, time, and alarm settings.
- Alarm Setting and Toggling: Users can set the alarm time using buttons and toggle alarm status with a button press.
- Auditory Alarm: A buzzer produces a distinct sound when the set alarm time matches the current time.
- Visual Display: The LCD displays the date, time, and alarm status (set or not set).
- Snooze Feature: The project can be expanded to include a snooze feature, allowing users to delay the alarm.

Technologies and Components:
- Arduino UNO: The project is built on the Arduino UNO board, serving as the microcontroller.
- RTC Module: The `virtuabotixRTC` library interfaces with a real-time clock module for accurate time and datekeeping.
- LiquidCrystal_I2C Library: The library enables communication with the I2C-connected LCD display.
- Buttons: Main, left, and right buttons are used for alarm toggling and time setting.
- Buzzer: A piezo buzzer generates sound signals for the audible alarm.
- Programming Language: The project is coded in the Arduino programming language (a subset of C/C++).

Project Workflow:
1. Initialize components, including buttons, the LCD display, and the RTC module.
2. Display the current date, time, and alarm status on the LCD.
3. Set and toggle alarms using buttons, with the LCD reflecting changes.
4. Monitor RTC time and trigger the buzzer when the alarm matches the current time.
5. Turn off the alarm or adjust settings as needed.
